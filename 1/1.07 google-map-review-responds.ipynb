    "# Google Maps Review Responder\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python app automates the process of fetching and responding Google Maps reviews for any business or location.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The app performs two main tasks:\n",
    "1. **Scrape Reviews** – Uses a web scraping script to extract reviews directly from Google Maps.\n",
    "2. **Respond Content** – Leverages OpenAI or Claude language models to generate concise, insightful summaries of the collected reviews and analyse the sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tech Stack\n",
    "- **Python** – Core language\n",
    "- **Playwright** – For scraping reviews\n",
    "- **OpenAI API** – For natural language summarization\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook** – For exploration, testing, and demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Credits\n",
    "The web scraping logic is **inspired by [Antonello Zanini’s blog post](https://blog.apify.com/how-to-scrape-google-reviews/)** on building a Google Reviews scraper. Special thanks for the valuable insights on **structuring and automating the scraping workflow**, which greatly informed the development of this improved scraper.\n",
    "\n",
    "This app, however, uses an **enhanced version of the scraper** that can scroll infinitely to load more reviews until it collects **at least 1,000 reviews**. If only a smaller number of reviews are available, the scraper stops scrolling earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This project is intended for educational and research purposes. Please ensure compliance with Google’s [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) when scraping or using their data.\n"

Of course I\\'m gonna leave a review for Costco. But in all seriousness, this is my four-star review for Costco, and in all honesty, it has served quite well for the past 15 years.

We get stuff for the house or sometimes for work, who knows, but it\\'s been every week consistently for 15 years.\\n\\nI gotta be honest; it\\'s always pretty solid.

The workers are usually the coolest, but it\\'s not perfect because of, well, literally the workers.\\n\\nThe workers here sometimes take their job too seriously, which I get. You can\\'t let non-members in, but hassling your members too? That\\'s just getting annoying. Sometimes I\\'ll just come here to get a hotdog from the food court because I\\'m in the mood, and every time I go in, they\\'re always hassling and yelling at me, \"Sir, you can\\'t go there, you need a membership,\" even though I show them my membership. They make me walk through the whole store instead of just going straight to the food court.\\n\\nAnd there was this one time my mom sent me with her Costco card to buy something. I had my membership, but they said they couldn\\'t help because it wasn\\'t the Visa card belonging to the member, so they turned me away.\\n\\nBut enough negatives. Nearly all the time, the staff are really nice, and in a super rare Costco moment, they aren\\'t stingy with the samples. So, 4 out of 5 stars for this 15-year and still running location.'}, {'user_url': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112447192982754656721/reviews?hl=en-US', 'username': 'Ellen Daily', 'stars': 5, 'time': '2 months ago', 'text': \"Need membership.

When I tried to step slightly inside the shaded entrance of the tire center just to escape the heat, the staff signaled for me to move away in a very dismissive and disrespectful manner.\\n\\nWhat made this experience even worse was noticing that other customers were treated more courteously their cars were brought to them, and the keys were handed over politely.

As an Indian customer, this made me feel singled out and discriminated against, as if I was being treated differently because of my background.\\n\\nI understand that everyone has a job to do, but respect and equality should be extended to all customers, regardless of their background.

Sometimes I\\'ll just come here to get a hotdog from the food court because I\\'m in the mood, and every time I go in, they\\'re always hassling and yelling at me, \"Sir, you can\\'t go there, you need a membership,\" even though I show them my membership. They make me walk through the whole store instead of just going straight to the food court.\\n\\nAnd there was this one time my mom sent me with her Costco card to buy something. I had my membership, but they said they couldn\\'t help because it wasn\\'t the Visa card belonging to the member, so they turned me away.\\n\\nBut enough negatives. Nearly all the time, the staff are really nice, and in a super rare Costco moment, they aren\\'t stingy with the samples. So, 4 out of 5 stars for this 15-year and still running location.'}, 'response': 'Here’s a detailed analysis of the review and the sentiment it conveys, plus a sample public reply you could use if you’re responding as the business.\\n\\n1) Overall sentiment\\n- Primary sentiment: Positive with notable caveats. The reviewer rates the experience 4 out of 5 stars and frames Costco as a long-standing, reliable pick for his family.\\n- Mixed/negative elements: The reviewer voices frustration about staff behavior and enforcement of membership policies, including a specific incident involving a card and guest access. These negatives reduce the overall tone from \"excellent\" to \"good with regular issues.\"\\n- Net takeaway: The location is seen as dependable and valuable, but customer experience is inconsistent due to how membership rules are enforced and how staff handle non-members or guest scenarios.\\n\\n2) Key positives highlighted\\n- Long-term value and reliability: “15 years,” weekly visits, consistently stocked.\\n- Good selection and deals: “coolest stuff in stock,” “best deals,” not running out of items.\\n- Positive staff interactions: “staff are usually the coolest,” generous with samples on occasion.\\n- Food court and small perks: mentions enjoying the hotdog and occasional samples.\\n- Overall loyalty: strong family usage and habit, suggesting trust in the store despite hiccups.\\n\\n3) Key negatives / areas for improvement\\n- Harsh or overly strict staff behavior: “they take their job too seriously,” “hassling and yelling,” and forcing a longer route to the food court.\\n- Enforcement of membership policies: frustration with non-members not being allowed in and the sense that policy is applied inconsistently or in an unfriendly way.\\n- Specific incident about card policy: being turned away because of a card situation (mom’s card vs. Visa card belonging to the member) indicates confusion or poor handling of guest/family scenarios.\\n- Occasional policy communication gaps: the reviewer’s experience suggests a need for clearer signage or training so expectations are set properly.\\n\\n4) What this review says about the business\\n- Strengths: Consistent product availability, strong value, and generally friendly staff who can occasionally be generous.\\n- Pain points: Enforcement approach and customer service tone, especially around membership rules and guest purchasing scenarios; need for better staff training and clearer guidance on non-member/guest situations.\\n\\n5) Suggestions for the business (actionable)\\n- Training and policy clarity: Provide customer-service training focused on polite, helpful enforcement of membership rules, with emphasis on de-escalation and clear explanations rather than “hassling.”\\n- Signage and messaging: Improve visibility of guest/entry policies to reduce confusion at the door and at the point of sale.\\n- Guest situations: Establish a clear, consistent process for handling family members or guests trying to use a member’s card, including what can be done if the cardholder is not present or if a Visa-only rule applies.\\n- Feedback loop: Create a quick way for frontline staff to escalate unusual guest scenarios to a supervisor, reducing negative experiences for customers who ask questions.\\n- Maintain strengths: Keep prioritizing product availability, pricing, and the positive, friendly moments (e.g., food samples) that the reviewer noted.\\n\\n6) Suggested public reply (to post as the business)\\n- Private note: If you want to respond publicly to this review, here’s a respectful, constructive reply you can adapt:\\n  - Hi Ameen, thank you for sharing your long-time experience with us. We’re glad to hear your family has found value in our selection, deals, and the consistency you’ve relied on for years.

We’ll share your feedback with store leadership and our training team to reinforce friendly, helpful service and clearer guidance on guest and card scenarios.
