    "# Google Maps Review Responder\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python app automates the process of fetching and responding Google Maps reviews for any business or location.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The app performs two main tasks:\n",
    "1. **Scrape Reviews** – Uses a web scraping script to extract reviews directly from Google Maps.\n",
    "2. **Respond Content** – Leverages OpenAI or Claude language models to generate concise, insightful summaries of the collected reviews and analyse the sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tech Stack\n",
    "- **Python** – Core language\n",
    "- **Playwright** – For scraping reviews\n",
    "- **OpenAI API** – For natural language summarization\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook** – For exploration, testing, and demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Credits\n",
    "The web scraping logic is **inspired by [Antonello Zanini’s blog post](https://blog.apify.com/how-to-scrape-google-reviews/)** on building a Google Reviews scraper. Special thanks for the valuable insights on **structuring and automating the scraping workflow**, which greatly informed the development of this improved scraper.\n",
    "\n",
    "This app, however, uses an **enhanced version of the scraper** that can scroll infinitely to load more reviews until it collects **at least 1,000 reviews**. If only a smaller number of reviews are available, the scraper stops scrolling earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This project is intended for educational and research purposes. Please ensure compliance with Google’s [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) when scraping or using their data.\n"

Of course I\\'m gonna leave a review for Costco. But in all seriousness, this is my four-star review for Costco, and in all honesty, it has served quite well for the past 15 years. I\\'ve been going here with my family literally every weekend. We get stuff for the house or sometimes for work, who knows, but it\\'s been every week consistently for 15 years.\\n\\nI gotta be honest; it\\'s always pretty solid. They always have the coolest stuff in stock, and we always get the best deals. We rarely run out of anything because we keep getting stuff from here. The workers are usually the coolest, but it\\'s not perfect because of, well, literally the workers.\\n\\nThe workers here sometimes take their job too seriously, which I get. You can\\'t let non-members in, but hassling your members too? That\\'s just getting annoying. Sometimes I\\'ll just come here to get a hotdog from the food court because I\\'m in the mood, and every time I go in, they\\'re always hassling and yelling at me, \"Sir, you can\\'t go there, you need a membership,\" even though I show them my membership. They make me walk through the whole store instead of just going straight to the food court.\\n\\nAnd there was this one time my mom sent me with her Costco card to buy something. I had my membership, but they said they couldn\\'t help because it wasn\\'t the Visa card belonging to the member, so they turned me away.\\n\\nBut enough negatives. Nearly all the time, the staff are really nice, and in a super rare Costco moment, they aren\\'t stingy with the samples. So, 4 out of 5 stars for this 15-year and still running location.'}, {'user_url': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112447192982754656721/reviews?hl=en-US', 'username': 'Ellen Daily', 'stars': 5, 'time': '2 months ago', 'text': \"Need membership.

I was then told to go to the back parking area to pick up my car. It was afternoon, and the sun was extremely hot. I waited in the sun for about 20 minutes without any shade or proper guidance. When I tried to step slightly inside the shaded entrance of the tire center just to escape the heat, the staff signaled for me to move away in a very dismissive and disrespectful manner.\\n\\nWhat made this experience even worse was noticing that other customers were treated more courteously their cars were brought to them, and the keys were handed over politely. In my case, I was simply given the keys and told to go, with no assistance or similar respect. As an Indian customer, this made me feel singled out and discriminated against, as if I was being treated differently because of my background.\\n\\nI understand that everyone has a job to do, but respect and equality should be extended to all customers, regardless of their background.
