       "\n",
       "Here is the step-by-step explanation:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Visualize the Books:** The two volumes are standing side-by-side in the correct order. Volume 1 is on the left, and Volume 2 is on the right.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Identify What's Touching:** Because of this arrangement, the **back cover of Volume 1** is touching the **front cover of Volume 2**.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Pinpoint the Start and End:** This is the tricky part.\n",
       "    *   The worm starts at the **first page of Volume 1**. When a book is closed and on a shelf, its first page is physically right behind the front cover.\n",
       "    *   The worm ends at the **last page of Volume 2**. This page is physically right in front of the back cover.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Trace the Path:**\n",
       "    *   The worm starts at the first page of Volume 1. Because Volume 1 is on the left, its first page is on the far left side of the block of pages.\n",
       "    *   The worm ends on the last page of Volume 2. Because Volume 2 is on the right, its last page is on the far right side of that block of pages.\n",
       "\n",
       "    Let's re-examine the book's orientation. This is the key to the riddle:\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   The **first page** of Volume 1 is physically adjacent to its front cover.\n",
       "    *   The **last page** of Volume 1 is physically adjacent to its back cover.\n",
       "\n",
       "    Looking at the books on the shelf from left to right:\n",
       "    [Front Cover V1] <— **START** [Pages V1] [Back Cover V1] [Front Cover V2] [Pages V2] **END** —> [Back Cover V2]\n",
       "\n",
       "    The worm starts on the *inside* of the front cover of Volume 1. To get to the last page of Volume 2, it does **not** travel through the pages of Volume 1. It is already on the other side of them.\n",
       "\n",
       "    The path is simply through the two covers that are in the middle:\n",
       "    1.  The back cover of Volume 1 (2 mm)\n",
       "    2.  The front cover of Volume 2 (2 mm)\n",
